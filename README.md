# simple-monads

This library is my own attempt at implementing the most common monads in an
effort to understand them better.
I will probably use this library in my own personal projects but if you're
looking for something solid you're better off with other libraries.

These are some repositories that inspired me :

- [TsMonad](https://github.com/cbowdon/TsMonad)
- [typescript-monads](https://github.com/patrickmichalina/typescript-monads)

Of course, the the book that started it all for me is
[Learn You a Haskel for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and you should read it.

I also tried to make my implementation (loosely) compliant with [fantasy-land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land)
